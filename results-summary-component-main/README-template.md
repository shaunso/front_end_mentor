## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Begun by focussing on the layout of the page without any styles.
- Mobile:
    - used a 4x1 grid to layout this page on mobile devices
    - within the main grid sections with the result and summary, display flex is used to layout the items in each section

- Media queries used to dynamically adjust the grid layout based on the screen size of the device
